# Witch Chess!
A blitz chess game with magic spells that can be played over the internet. Available here: https://witch-chess.vercel.app/

To play, simply sign-up and log in. The backend server is run via Fly.io and needs some time to start up if it has been idle, so it may take a moment for that to happen.
